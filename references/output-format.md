# Deliverable Output Format

database-generator-skill produces a standard set of deliverables on every run, laid out as follows:

```
output/
├── schema.sql          # DDL (tables, constraints, indexes)
├── erd.md              # Mermaid ERD
├── seed.py             # imports data from source files (or seed.sql)
├── migrations/
│   └── 001_init.up.sql / 001_init.down.sql
└── report.md           # modeling report (see below)
```

## schema.sql requirements

- File-header comment: generation time, target engine, source-file list
- One section per table; the table comment states the source file
- Every index annotated with the query it serves: `-- serves Q3: SELECT ... WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY created_at`
- Every foreign key annotated with the reason for its ON DELETE choice
- Every denormalized column must carry a comment naming the query it serves

## erd.md requirements

Mermaid `erDiagram`, with cardinality and FK columns annotated between entities.

## report.md template

```markdown
# Database Modeling Report

## Input

## Decision Record
| # | Decision | Basis (methodology clause) |

## Foreign-Key Adjudication
